The approach integrates the use of PropertyGuru's Malaysia Properties Information datasets, including Project Metadata (Malaysia’s property description information) and MY Sales Fact (Malaysia’s property sales transactions)

Filtering and Grouping was applied to both datasets, focusing exclusively on high-rise property types, such as condominiums and apartments. Stratified sampling was performed on the project metadata to obtain representative samples for the experiment.

The filtered and sampled results were cross-joined using BigQuery, and the outcomes were divided into two categories:

-   The first category includes records with a Levenshtein (Lev) score above 0.95. The Lev score is a similarity measure where 1 is the highest, indicating identical project names. This segment represents 28% of the total sample, with records in this range assumed to be already matched.

<!-- -->

-   The second category consists of records with Lev scores between 0.65 and 0.95, which account for 40% of the samples. Project pairs with a Lev score below 0.65 are assumed to be unmatched. The score range between 0.65 and 0.95 represents a "grey area," where further accuracy assessment will be conducted using the OpenAI API.
