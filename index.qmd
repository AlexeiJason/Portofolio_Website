### Welcome to my portfolio. I am a data analyst who enjoys making sense of numbers and transforming them into valuable insights. I work with Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to explore data, uncover patterns, and create visuals that help people make smarter decisions. {style="text-align: center;"}

### In this portfolio, you will find some of my favorite projects. from digging deep into messy datasets, creating clean and meaningful analyses, to building dashboards that actually tell a story (not just look pretty). I'm always looking for new challenges, and Iâ€™m excited about opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from others, and make an impact. {style="text-align: center;"}
